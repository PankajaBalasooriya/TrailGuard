\section{Problem Description}


%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Problem}
In today’s rapidly changing environment, outdoor enthusiasts such as hikers, cavers, and travelers face increasing challenges related to environmental conditions. The quality of air and water is not always visible, yet it plays a crucial role in health and safety. Hikers often encounter water sources during their journeys, but determining whether the water is safe for drinking or swimming is difficult without proper equipment. Additionally, exposure to harmful gases, especially in caves or enclosed spaces, can be hazardous. The lack of portable, comprehensive solutions that monitor these vital environmental parameters poses a significant risk to those who venture into nature.

\subsection{Solution}
TrailGuard is a portable device designed to address these challenges by providing real-time monitoring of key environmental parameters such as air quality, water quality, temperature, and humidity. Equipped with a range of sensors, including a TS-300B turbidity sensor, PH4502C pH sensor, DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, Sharp GP2Y1010AU0F dust sensor, and MQ2 gas sensor, TrailGuard offers a comprehensive solution for assessing environmental conditions. The device also includes a buzzer and LED indicator to alert users to potential dangers, making it a valuable addition to any hiker's gear. The Atmega328P-AU microcontroller serves as the brain of the device, ensuring efficient operation and control over the various sensors and user interfaces.

\subsection{Motivation}
The motivation behind TrailGuard stems from the growing need for safety and awareness among outdoor enthusiasts. With the increasing popularity of hiking, caving, and other outdoor activities, there is a rising demand for reliable tools that can help individuals assess and respond to environmental risks. TrailGuard aims to empower users with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions about the air they breathe, the water they encounter, and the overall environmental conditions during their adventures. By providing a portable, user-friendly solution, TrailGuard enhances the safety and enjoyment of outdoor experiences.

\subsection{Justification}
The development of TrailGuard is justified by the clear demand for a compact, reliable device that addresses multiple environmental concerns in one package. 

To validate the problem and understand the needs and preferences of potential users, we conducted a survey among hikers, adventurers, and students across universities in Sri Lanka. Out of 150 responses, we randomly selected 100 samples for analysis.

\end{tikzpicture}

The survey revealed significant concerns about environmental safety during outdoor activities. Notably, 80\% of respondents reported facing issues due to contaminated air and water while traveling. Despite this, only one respondent owned a device capable of measuring water quality. 

The majority of participants (95\%) expressed a strong interest in owning a product like TrailGuard, and 93\% believed that such a device would enhance their overall travel experience.

Furthermore, our research indicated a lack of existing products that offer the same combination of functionalities as TrailGuard. While there are devices available that measure either water or air quality, they tend to be expensive and lack the comprehensive monitoring capabilities of our design. Additionally, social media research highlighted frequent complaints from tourists in the South Asian region about unknowingly drinking contaminated water, leading to unexpected health issues during their travels.

These factors, combined with the positive feedback from our survey, strongly support the need for TrailGuard. The device’s ability to monitor air and water quality, detect harmful gases, and measure temperature and humidity in a single, portable form factor makes it a valuable tool for enhancing safety and enjoyment during outdoor adventures.
